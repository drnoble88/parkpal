Today, we took on the formidable challenge of implementing backend authorization. It was a complex task, requiring us to navigate through the existing code for authorization. Although it proved to be difficult, this challenge presented an opportunity for us to explore and learn how to read man pages. This new skill was essential in overcoming the obstacles we encountered.

We achieved success in completing the update and delete operations for our endpoints. Additionally, we made an important enhancement by adding an "accounts_id" foreign key column to our trips database. This addition enables us to associate each trip with a specific account, thereby improving the functionality of our system.

During this session, we accomplished two significant tasks. Firstly, we populated our database with all the national parks' data and created routes to retrieve information about a single park or all parks. While dealing with the data from the third-party API presented some challenges, we persevered and managed to extract the desired information. This progress made implementing additional queries and routes less daunting.

Today, we successfully completed the front-end authorization phase. Although it was a demanding task, we were able to overcome the challenges with the help of instructional videos and support from the SEIR team. Understanding the process of acquiring and storing tokens in Redux proved to be the most challenging aspect.

Our focus today was on developing the login, sign-up, and logout pages. It is truly gratifying to witness the progress we have made so far and see our website coming together. Handling the user accounts aspect has brought us closer to achieving a significant milestone in our project.

5/26/2023

During today's session, we dedicated our efforts to working on the homepage. We successfully implemented a visually appealing carousel view, enabling users to click on a button within the carousel to access a detailed view of a specific park. The outcome was fantastic! Additionally, we made significant progress on the "create a trip" page, having a rough working version in place.

5/30/2023

We reached a major milestone by getting the navbar up and running on our home page. We also implemented a verification process to hide the login and sign-up buttons for logged-in users. This enhancement improves the user experience and provides a seamless interface.

5/31/2023

Today, we integrated a search bar into our homepage, allowing users to search for parks by name. As a result, the carousel dynamically updates to display the specific park searched for. Furthermore, we made progress on the details page and successfully linked the button to the corresponding detail page, marking a significant breakthrough.

6/02/2023

We made several improvements to the detail page, enhancing its visual appeal with a better background image and an improved content box. Additionally, we implemented a carousel view to display pictures of the specific national park. To further enhance the user experience, we added a "My Trips" page, which showcases all upcoming trips associated with a user's account, along with options to edit and delete trips. The navbar was also refined to only show the "Create a Trip" and "My Trips" options for logged-in users, ensuring consistency across the site.

6/05/2023

We resolved the issue of page refreshing after user login, ensuring that the "My Trips" and "Create a Trip" buttons are now visible on the navbar when logged in. Additionally, we successfully implemented the edit page, allowing users to view and make edits to their previous entries.

6/06/2023

Today, we conducted unit tests based on Riley's instructional videos, ensuring that our trip routes return data in the correct format and accept the appropriate parameters. Furthermore, we optimized the homepage by enabling users to select a specific state, resulting in the display of only the parks associated with that state. As a consequence, the search bar functionality had to be temporarily removed.

6/07/2023

We focused on enhancing the visual appeal of the "My Trips" page, specifically improving the appearance of the cards displayed to the user. By applying additional styling, we aimed to create a more pleasant experience. Additionally, we identified and fixed a bug on the edit page, ensuring that everything functions as intended.

6/08/2023

On the details page, we implemented a link that allows users to easily book a trip for a specific national park. By clicking a button, users are redirected to a pre-filled "Create a Trip" page tailored to that specific park, simplifying the trip creation process. Additionally, we refined the buttons across all pages and ensured a cohesive theme throughout the website.

6/09/2023

Today marks the final day of our project. We conducted a meticulous review of the entire website to ensure that everything was functioning as intended. During the inspection, we encountered an issue on the "My Trips" page where the trip dates were displayed one day ahead of the scheduled dates. We promptly addressed and resolved this issue, ensuring accurate date representation. Additionally, we dedicated time to enhance the visual appeal of the page by styling its title.

Furthermore, we performed a thorough file cleanup, diligently removing any traces of unused code or unnecessary comments. As part of our optimization efforts, we consolidated all the CSS into the index.css file. Additionally, we streamlined the styling process by consolidating all the styling instructions into a single JavaScript file.

Overall, we are delighted with the progress we have made, ensuring that the project is in excellent shape and ready for deployment.
