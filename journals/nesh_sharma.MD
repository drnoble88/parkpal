Today, we tackled the challenging task of implementing backend authorization. Navigating through the existing code for authorization proved to be quite difficult. However, this challenge also presented an opportunity for us to learn how to read man pages for the first time, as it was necessary to overcome the obstacles we faced.

We successfully completed the update and delete operations for our endpoints, and we also added an `accounts_id` foreign key column to our trips database. This addition allows us to associate each trip with a specific account, enhancing the functionality of our system.

In this session, we accomplished two major tasks. Firstly, we seeded all the national parks into our database and created routes to retrieve information about a single park or all parks. Manipulating the data obtained from the third-party API presented some difficulties, but we persisted and managed to extract the desired information. Subsequently, implementing additional queries and routes became less challenging.

Today, we successfully completed the front-end authorization phase. It was also a demanding task, but with the help of Riley's videos and support from the SEIR team, we were able to overcome the obstacles. Understanding how the token was acquired and stored in Redux proved to be the most challenging part of the process.

Our focus for the day was on developing the login, sign-up, and logout pages. Witnessing the progress we have made so far and seeing our website come together is truly satisfying. Handling the users' account portion has brought us closer to achieving a significant milestone in our project.

During today's session, we dedicated our efforts to working on the homepage. We managed to implement a visually appealing carousel view, allowing users to click on a button within the carousel to access a detailed view of a specific park. The result turned out great! Additionally, we made significant progress on the "create a trip" page, having a rough working version in place.

We accomplished a major milestone by getting the navbar up and running on our home page. We also implemented a verification process to hide the login and sign-up buttons for logged-in users. This feature enhances the user experience and provides a seamless interface.

# 5/31/2023
Today, we integrated a search bar into our homepage, enabling users to search for parks by name. As a result, the carousel dynamically updates to display the specific park searched for. Furthermore, we made progress on the details page and successfully linked the button to the corresponding detail page, marking a significant breakthrough.

# 6/02/2023
We made several improvements to the detail page, enhancing its visual appeal with a better background image and an improved content box. Additionally, we implemented a carousel view for displaying pictures of the specific national park. To enhance user experience further, we added a "My Trips" page, which displays all upcoming trips associated with a user's account, along with options to edit and delete trips. The navbar was also refined to only show the "Create a Trip" and "My Trips" options for logged-in users, maintaining consistency across the site.

# 6/05/2023
We resolved the issue with page refreshing after user login, ensuring that the "My Trips" and "Create a Trip" buttons are now visible on the navbar when logged in. Additionally, we successfully implemented the edit page, allowing users to view and make edits to their previous entries.

# 6/06/2023
Today, we conducted unit tests following Riley's instructional videos, ensuring that our trip routes return data

 in the correct format and accept the appropriate parameters. Furthermore, we optimized the homepage by enabling users to select a specific state, thereby displaying only the parks associated with that state. As a consequence, the search bar functionality had to be temporarily removed.

# 6/07/2023
We focused on enhancing the visual appeal of the "My Trips" page, specifically the cards displayed to the user. By introducing additional styling, we aimed to create a more pleasing experience. Additionally, we identified and fixed a bug on the edit page, ensuring that everything functions as intended.

# 6/08/2023
On the details page, we implemented a link that allows users to easily book a trip for a specific national park. By clicking a button, users are redirected to a pre-filled "Create a Trip" page tailored to that specific park, simplifying the trip creation process. Additionally, we refined the buttons across all pages and ensured a cohesive theme throughout the website.
