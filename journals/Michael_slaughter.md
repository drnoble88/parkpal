May 15th: We configured the working YAML file by setting up the necessary configurations and parameters, ensuring a smooth integration of the file with the project. This involved carefully reviewing the file structure and making any required modifications.


May 17th: We completed the backend authorization using FastAPI, an efficient Python framework for building web applications. We implemented the necessary authentication mechanisms and security protocols, including user authentication and authorization endpoints, handling user login and registration, and validating user credentials.


May 18th: We implemented the update and delete trip operations for endpoints in the FastAPI backend. This allowed users to modify and remove their trip data stored in PostgreSQL, a powerful and reliable open-source database management system. Additionally, we added a foreign key in the database schema to associate trips with user accounts, ensuring proper data relationships.


May 22nd: We integrated a third-party API into the FastAPI backend, leveraging its capabilities to connect to external services and incorporate the required functionality. This involved configuring API endpoints, handling API requests and responses, and parsing the received data to fit the project's needs.


May 23rd: We populated the PostgreSQL database with national parks data by writing scripts or utilizing data import tools. We created routes in FastAPI to retrieve individual parks or fetch all parks, ensuring seamless access to national parks data from the database.


May 24th: We developed the frontend login and landing page using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We designed and implemented the necessary components and UI elements for user authentication and the initial landing page of the website.


May 25th: We implemented the login, logout, and signup functionality in the React frontend. We programmed the necessary logic and components to handle user authentication actions, including designing and implementing user interface elements for login, logout, and signup forms.


May 26th: We successfully implemented the creation of a trip feature in the React frontend, allowing users to create new trips and save them in the system. We styled the homepage using CSS and applied React component styling frameworks to enhance the visual presentation.


May 30th: We ensured the proper functionality of the navbar in the React frontend. We implemented the necessary logic and styling to create a responsive navigation bar that worked seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.


May 31st: We linked the detail page from the homepage in the React frontend, establishing a connection between the homepage and the detailed page for each trip or park. We implemented conditional rendering to control the visibility of certain navbar links based on user authentication status.


June 2nd: We added the delete and edit functionality to the trip page in the React frontend. We enabled users to delete or modify their existing trip data through interactive components and forms. We improved the appearance of the trip form using CSS and React styling techniques.


June 5th: We resolved issues with the update page in the React frontend. We identified and fixed any bugs or errors related to the update functionality, ensuring a smooth user experience when updating trip data.


June 6th: We optimized the homepage and fixed unit tests in the React frontend. We reviewed the existing codebase and made optimizations to improve performance and efficiency. We addressed any failing or malfunctioning unit tests to maintain a high level of test coverage and reliability.


June 7th: We applied CSS to the trip form page in the React frontend, adding custom styles and design elements to enhance the visual appearance and user experience. We fixed any issues related to data slices and ensured the proper display and manipulation of data within the trip and edit pages.


June 8th: We created a link to book a trip from the detail page in the React frontend. We implemented functionality that allows users to easily navigate from the detail page to the booking page for a specific trip. We made CSS improvements throughout the entire website, refining the styles, layout, and visual elements to create a polished and cohesive user interface.


June 9th: Finally, at the end of our project journey for now, and ready to submit for grading. Feel a lot of pressure off of my chest now, and ready to start studying for the final assessment.
